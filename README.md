(gensph.m) generates given number of points onto a sphere of given raius written by Wanjin. Can change shape of surface by adjusting the angles swept in the code.
(gensph_equidist) written by Xan based on Markus Deserno paper, generates points equideistantlly spaced on a sphere. Needs to be updated to take the distance as input instead of number of points.
(spharm) spherical harmonic function given theta, phi, l, and m
(vsh_modified_in) vector spherical harmonic function
(Sin/Sout) calculates single-origin vector spherical harmonic expansion (SSS) for a given sensor geometry. As examples to see how (spharm) and (vsh_modified_in) are used in the context of MEG.
